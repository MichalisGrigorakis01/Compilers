* Compile the Project: "make all"

* Run the Project: "./calc text file"

* Remove .c, txt, .out: "make clean"

* Implementation:
   -  We implemented almost everything in the project with some minor problems in some cases.
   -  Quads are printed in both the console and in quads.txt
   -  We implemented correctly while, if else, break, continue

* Problems:
   - In tests such as: `x = a and not true;`, the system throws error if a variable is used but not defined first. So please in those cases use `a = <something>;` before running the test again. We print an error message every time this happens and the exact variables that need to be defined. (This happens a lot in the testfiles).
