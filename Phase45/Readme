* Compile the Project: "make all"

* Run the Project: "./calc text file"

* Remove .c, txt, .out: "make clean"

* Implementation:
   - Build:
      - We didn't seperate the avm implementation in a seperate executable, since we are using global variables for safety from other files (like totals etc.).
      - Despite of that, the avm relies fully in the .abc file we generate.

   - Library Functions: 
      - In some of these functions we print the input we give them. 
        Please use them like this in order to not get confused: `print(sqrt(526),nl);` or `print(cos(90),nl);`
        Output:
               `526.00 22.93`
               `90.00 0.00`
         - print(): It works fine.
         - input(): It works fine.
         - typeof(): It works fine.
         - sqrt(): It works fine. It also prints nil after, if there is not a sqrt of the number.
         - cos(): Works fine.
         - strtonum(): Works fine. It also prints nil after the input.
         - sin(): Works fine.

   - Relop Logic: It works fine.

   - New Line: 
      - For printing reasons we have added a `printf("\n");` in exec_libfunc.c at the end of function: void libfunc_print(void)
      - You can remove it if you have `nl` in the testfiles when you call print
   
   - if statements:
      - Works fine except in a scenario like this:
                                                   if(i%2 == 0){
                                                      print(i);
                                                      print("  ");
                                                   }
      - The above works if we do this like this:
                                                   j = i%2;
                                                   if(j == 0){
                                                      print(i);
                                                      print("  ");
                                                   }
   
   - Loops:
      - break, continue don't work properly
   
   - Functions: Works if we put an argument in function and function call.
      - Parameter in the function doesn't work (it says undefined).
   
   - Tables: Work except the following:
      - Don't work: `::, .`

   - Testfiles:
      - 07: Pass
      - 08: Pass
      - 09: Pass
      - 10: Pass (except break, continue, above problem)
      - 11: Not Passed (Nested don't work)
